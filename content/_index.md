      title: Research Interests
      subtitle: 'Artifical Intelligence'
      text: |-
          ### Machine Learning
          My primary research focus lies in the expansive and rapidly evolving field of Machine Learning, driven by its potential to revolutionize industries and solve complex problems. I am particularly passionate about the interdisciplinary nature of machine learning, which allows me to blend theory and application to develop innovative solutions across various domains. My research spans several cutting-edge subdomains, where I aim to contribute both to the advancement of theoretical foundations and to the practical deployment of machine learning systems.

          ### Federated Learning
          As the demand for privacy-preserving machine learning grows, my work focuses on federated learning techniques, which allow models to be trained on decentralized data while maintaining user privacy. This is particularly relevant in industries like healthcare and finance, where sensitive data is prevalent.

          ### Reinforcement Learning
          This branch of machine learning excites me due to its potential for solving complex, dynamic decision-making problems. My research aims to apply reinforcement learning techniques to areas like robotics and game AI, where agents learn optimal behaviors through interaction with their environments.

          ### Computer Vision
          I am particularly fascinated by how machine learning models can be used to understand and 
          interpret visual information from the world. I focus on developing algorithms for image 
          classification, object detection, and segmentation, aiming to improve automation in tasks 
          like medical imaging, autonomous driving, and video surveillance.

          ### Cognitive Computing
          I am intrigued by how machine learning can mimic human thought processes, leading to the development of systems capable of reasoning, learning, and decision-making in real time. My research focuses on applying cognitive computing to areas like natural language understanding and intelligent systems.

          ### Cloud Computing
          With the growing adoption of cloud platforms, I am exploring how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed and scaled in cloud environments. My interest here lies in leveraging cloud resources to facilitate real-time processing, distributed learning, and scalable data pipelines.

          ### Health Informatics
          he healthcare sector presents a unique opportunity to apply machine learning to improve patient outcomes, disease prediction, and treatment personalization. I am focused on leveraging machine learning models for early diagnosis, predictive analytics in patient data, and optimizing healthcare operations. This includes using deep learning for medical imaging, federated learning for secure data sharing between hospitals, and reinforcement learning to optimize treatment plans. By integrating AI-driven solutions into healthcare systems, I aim to contribute to more efficient, accurate, and accessible care.
