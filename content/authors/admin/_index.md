<div style="text-align: justify">Hello, this is <strong>Md Tousif Hasan Lavlu.</strong> Currenlty, I am serving as a <strong>Lecturer</strong> at  <strong>Shanto-Mariam University of Creative Technology</strong>, department of CSE. I have completed my <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering</strong> from <strong><em>BRAC University</strong></em> and currently pursuing <strong>Master of Science in Information and Communication Techonology</strong> at <strong><em>Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).</strong></em> I have a strong interest in<strong> Machine Learning</strong>, particularly in its application to solve complex problems across various domains. My research focuses on enhancing machine learning models' predictive capabilities through novel techniques, including reinforcement learning for adaptive systems, federated learning for privacy-preserving collaboration, computer vision for improved visual interpretation, and cognitive computing to simulate human thought in complex scenarios.</div>
