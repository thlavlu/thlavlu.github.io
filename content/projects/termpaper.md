The Term Paper on Hyperparameter Tuning delves into optimizing machine learning models by fine-tuning hyperparameters across more than 10 different algorithms. Using the U.S. Congressional Voting Records dataset from UCI, this research systematically adjusts parameters such as learning rate, tree depth, and regularization strength to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. By examining a broad range of algorithms, the study highlights the significant improvements in model performance achievable through careful tuning. This research serves as a practical guide, underscoring the importance of hyperparameter tuning in refining predictive power and optimizing computational resources.
