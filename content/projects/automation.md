Selenium-Based Automated Browser Testing System is a Java-powered testing solution that uses Selenium WebDriver to automate browser interactions and validate web application functionality. Developed with Java, this system simulates user actions such as clicking, typing, and navigating pages, ensuring that applications perform seamlessly across multiple browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
