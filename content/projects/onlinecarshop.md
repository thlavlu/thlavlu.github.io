Online Car Shop is a full-stack eCommerce web application designed to streamline the process of buying and selling cars online. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), this platform provides users with a seamless experience for browsing, searching, and purchasing vehicles. It includes features such as user authentication, product listing, and a shopping cart, all integrated with a MongoDB database to manage user data and car inventory efficiently. The front end, developed in React, delivers a responsive and interactive interface, while the back end, powered by Node.js and Express.js, ensures robust API performance and secure transactions.
