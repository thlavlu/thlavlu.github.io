Online Technician Service is a web-based platform that connects individuals seeking technical assistance with skilled technicians. Users can post their technical issues or tasks, and technicians can bid on these jobs, providing competitive offers based on their expertise and availability. Once a technician is selected, they proceed to resolve the task through the platform.

This project is developed using a MERN stack:

- Frontend: React.js for an interactive user interface.
- Backend: Node.js and Express.js for handling server-side logic and API management.
- Database: MongoDB for flexible data storage and retrieval of user profiles, 
job postings, and bidding details.

The platform aims to streamline the process of finding reliable, skilled technical support, making it easier for users to get quick and efficient solutions.
