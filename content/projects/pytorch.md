PyTorch Project is a machine learning application that leverages PyTorch to build and train neural network models for predicting species of the Iris dataset. This project explores both fully connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

The stack includes:

- PyTorch as the primary machine learning library for model building and training.
- Iris dataset for training and testing, providing a simple yet effective dataset for classification tasks.

By implementing and comparing both neural network architectures, this project demonstrates PyTorch's flexibility and capability in handling both traditional and convolutional neural networks. It provides insights into model accuracy, training efficiency, and the suitability of CNNs for non-image data.
