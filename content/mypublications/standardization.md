<strong>Abstract: </strong>
<div style="text-align: justify">This research focuses on leveraging machine learning applications to enhance healthcare services, particularly through predictive modeling and data standardization. Predictive modeling plays a crucial role in analyzing patient data to forecast health outcomes, aiding in early diagnosis, risk stratification, and optimizing treatment plans. Machine learning algorithms can identify patterns in large datasets to predict chronic conditions, allocate resources efficiently by identifying high-risk patients, and reduce hospital readmissions. Additionally, data standardization is critical in addressing the fragmentation of electronic health records (EHRs). By employing machine learning techniques, heterogeneous healthcare data can be transformed into a standardized format, improving data quality, enabling interoperability between systems, and facilitating more comprehensive medical research. This research aims to drive advancements in healthcare by integrating these machine learning techniques, contributing to more personalized, efficient, and effective patient care.</div>
