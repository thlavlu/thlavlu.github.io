<strong>Abstract: </strong>
<div style="text-align: justify">In the 21st century, chatbots have been the latest and most widely used technology in our lives. A conversational chatbot is a dialogue system specially designed to interact with people as a real one. Human users can feel like having a conversation with another person. The system can be integrated with other systems to improve user experience and give users a natural feeling while using an artificial system. In recent days, the success of ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, showed the world a large hope to have more advanced and human-like chatbots. It increases the research possibilities on this topic. The existing algorithms showed mind-blowing results. So having a summary of all algorithms may help researchers to improve the work more. In this study, we will arrange a list of previous works of chatbots and review the results of the algorithms.</div>
