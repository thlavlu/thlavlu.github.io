<strong>Abstract: </strong>
<div style="text-align: justify">This paper explores the application of four classification algorithms—Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest classifiers—on the UCI 'Vote' dataset, which contains the voting records of United States Congress members in 1984. The primary goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these classifiers across various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, and specificity. The study identifies the Decision Tree classifier as the most effective model for this dataset, based on its superior performance metrics.</div>
