<strong>Abstract: </strong>
<div style="text-align: justify">Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a critical complication of diabetes mellitus and a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial in managing this condition effectively, as it allows for timely treatment to prevent irreversible vision loss. Although there are many Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning-based (DL) automatic techniques to detect DR, leveraging these methods in a decentralized manner poses challenges due to privacy concerns associated with medical data. Federated Learning (FL) addresses these challenges by enabling model training across distributed data sources without sharing sensitive information, thus facilitating collaborative research while safeguarding patient privacy. In our study, we implemented Federated Learning (FL) with a Lightweight Vision Transformer ( LViT) model (FLViT) on the Asia Pacific TeleOphthalmology Society 2019 Blindness Detection (APTOS 2019) dataset. This approach was compared against local models trained individually on LViT (non-FL-LViT) using datasets from separate institutions. It not only improved model performance but also ensured compliance with data protection regulations, achieving a recall of 95.2%, specificity of 95.8%, precision of 95.9%, F1-Score of 95.5%, and an accuracy of 96%. These results highlight the potential of proposed FLViT models in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and accessibility in diabetic retinopathy detection, paving the way for scalable and privacy-preserving healthcare solutions in ophthalmology.</div>
